## Software Project Management and Comprehension Tool
Maven is a powerful software project management tool that allows developers to easily create, configure, and build projects. In this lab, we learned how to set up Maven on our Windows machine and used it to manage our projects. We also covered advanced features such as automatically generating documentation and configuring dependencies to be included in the final jar file. Additionally, we learned how to write and run tests on our project using Maven. We now have a solid understanding of how to use Maven to manage our software projects.
